# Predicting US Elections with Python

This project uses sentiment analysis to predict the outcome of the US presidential elections. The analysis is based on tweets collected from the official Twitter handles of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets collected from the official Twitter handles of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](link to dataset).

## Methodology
The project uses the TextBlob package in Python to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets. The sentiment analysis is based on the polarity of the tweets, which ranges from -1 to +1 (negative to positive).

## Results
The results of the analysis show that Joe Biden is getting more positive tweets and fewer negative tweets compared to Donald Trump. This suggests that Joe Biden is more preferred by the people to win the US Presidential Elections than Donald Trump.

## Code
The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `TextBlob`
- `wordcloud`
- `plotly`

The code can be found in the `US_Elections.py` file.

## Visualization
The results of the analysis are visualized using a bar chart, which shows the number of positive and negative tweets for each candidate.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that Joe Biden is more likely to win the US Presidential Elections than Donald Trump.

## Future Work
This project can be extended to include more features, such as:

- Collecting more data from other sources, such as news articles and social media platforms
- Using more advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the predictions
- Analyzing the sentiment of specific issues, such as healthcare and economy, to understand the opinions of the people on these issues.
